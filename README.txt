# chipKitPong :ping_pong:
A  sideproject that includes making making a version of Pong on the Uno32 ChipKit

# Instructions:
1. Unzip folder
2. Plug in your chipKit
3. Navigate to the folder in your terminal
4. Write 'Make'
5. Write 'Make install "Port designated for chipkit"' (in our case TTYDEV=/dev/ttyS3)

# In game controls:
Use btn 4 to navigate the selector
Use btn 3 to select the selected option
You can always use sw4 to return to main menu when either in game or in another menu
When in One Player or Survival use btn 4 to raise paddle and btn 3 to lower paddle
Same controls applies in Two Player mode only difference being that btn 2 is used to raise the second players paddle and btn 1 is used to lower it

Also note that when inserting highscore after losing survival the btn 4 is used for scrolling through different characters and btn 3 is used for selecting the chosen character and moving to the next one
